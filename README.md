User script to add the "next quote" option. This allows you to type out all quotes after each other. The script actively checks for previous completion.

## Usage <span id="usage"></span>

Note: You can turn off the extension at any time by using the respective dialog as <a href="https://github.com/brentspine/monkeytype-quote-queue/assets/55391576/98ecee87-cf95-4a96-93fd-50db753cb968" target="_blank">seen here</a>

After enabling the extension head to "quotes" and reload the page to be safe. The extension will fetch all your results and all quotes and search for the first non-completed one. It will automatically start the test for that quote. It goes ordered by ID. I can maybe add sorting by length or other things if needed. Just [open an issue](https://github.com/brentspine/monkeytype-quote-queue/issues).

After completing a test, you can use the "Next Quote" button to, as you might have guesses, go to the next queued quote.

### Filtering <span id="usage-filtering"></span>

You can set a start timestamp for quote completion check. That means that quotes before that timestamp do not count into your completion percentage or general progress. This number is in <b>milliseconds</b>, this is important. You can get the current timestamp in milliseconds [here](https://brentspine.de/tools/live-timestamp/) or [here](https://currentmillis.com/).
